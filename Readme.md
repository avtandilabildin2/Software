## Overview

This project is a redesigned and improved version of the Computer Science Department website. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code have been consolidated into a single HTML file for easier maintenance and faster loading. The site now has a modern, responsive layout, and interactive elements like dropdown menus and a simple image slider.

## Changes Made

1. **HTML Structure**
    - Consolidated multiple HTML, CSS, and JS files into a single HTML file.
    - Reorganized the header, navigation, main content, and footer sections for better readability.
    - Replaced outdated tags and attributes with modern, semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).

2. **CSS Improvements**
    - Added internal CSS within the `<style>` tag for a single-file solution.
    - Improved responsiveness using flexbox for layout and media queries for mobile devices.
    - Styled navigation menu, dropdowns, slider, and content sections with modern colors, shadows, and rounded corners.
    - Removed redundant and outdated classes (like `container_16`, `grid_8`) to simplify layout.

3. **JavaScript Enhancements**
    - Replaced jQuery-based slider with a simple vanilla JS slider for images.
    - Added toggle functionality for dropdown menus without relying on external libraries.
    - Ensured smooth and automated slide transitions every 5 seconds.
    - Removed unnecessary external JS dependencies (like `nivo-slider` and `highlight.js`).

4. **Content Updates**
    - Updated main content with headings, paragraphs, and buttons for clarity.
    - Organized mission, vision, and merits sections into clean, card-like boxes.
    - Added `alt` attributes for all images to improve accessibility.

5. **Miscellaneous**
    - Added meta description and viewport for better SEO and mobile support.
    - Improved link accessibility by adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links.
    - Modernized footer and overall page aesthetics.

## Summary

The updated version is more **modern, lightweight, responsive, and maintainable**. All functionality is now contained in a single HTML file, making it easier to deploy and update.
