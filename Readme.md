Overview

This project successfully delivered a redesigned and improved version of the Computer Science Department website. A core goal of this update was to consolidate all code: the entire site is now contained within a single HTML file for significantly easier maintenance and faster loading. The resulting site features a modern, responsive layout and leverages vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements like dropdown menus and a simple image slider.

Key Changes & Improvements

1. ðŸ“‚ Code Consolidation and Structure

   Single-File Solution: Successfully merged all separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into a single, unified HTML file.

   Semantic HTML5: Replaced outdated tags with modern, semantic elements (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>) to improve code readability and SEO.

   Simplification: Reorganized the page structure (header, navigation, main content, footer) for better maintainability.

2. ðŸŽ¨ CSS and Layout Enhancements

   Internal Styling: Implemented all CSS internally within the <style> tag, supporting the single-file goal.

   Modern Responsiveness: Improved layout using flexbox and targeted media queries to ensure a flawless experience on mobile devices.

   Aesthetics: Applied a modern visual theme with contemporary colors, shadows, and rounded corners for navigation, dropdowns, and content sections.

   Layout Cleanup: Removed redundant and outdated layout classes (e.g., container_16, grid_8).

3. âœ¨ JavaScript Functionality

   Vanilla JS Implementation: Replaced all external JavaScript dependencies (like jQuery and nivo-slider) with simple, native JavaScript code.

   Interactive Elements: Developed toggle functionality for dropdown menus and a lightweight image slider for smooth, automated transitions every 5 seconds.

4. âœ… Content & Accessibility

   Accessibility Focus: Added required alt attributes to all images and implemented rel="noopener noreferrer" for external links to improve user security and accessibility.

   Clarity: Organized main content sections (Mission, Vision, Merits) into clean, visually appealing card-like boxes.

   SEO Optimization: Included crucial meta description and viewport settings for better search engine and mobile device support.

Summary

The updated website is a significant step forward, delivering a product that is demonstrably more modern, lightweight, responsive, and maintainable. The single-file architecture simplifies deployment and future updates, making the project highly successful.
